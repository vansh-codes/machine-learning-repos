# Air Quality Analysis and Health Impact Score Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing air quality data and predicting health impact scores based on various environmental factors. The analysis leverages machine learning techniques to provide insights into how air quality affects health.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gather air quality data from various sources.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis and visualize air quality trends.
- **Health Impact Prediction**: Predict health impact scores using machine learning models.
- **Customizable Models**: Easily update and train new models with different datasets.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-quality-analysis.git
    cd air-quality-analysis
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the data:**
    - Collect air quality data and store it in the `data/` directory.
    - Ensure the data is in a suitable format (e.g., CSV files).

2. **Run data analysis:**
    ```bash
    python src/analyze_data.py
    ```

3. **Train the prediction model:**
    ```bash
    python src/train_model.py
    ```

4. **Make predictions:**
    ```bash
    python src/predict.py
    ```

## Customization

To customize the data analysis and prediction models, update the configuration files and scripts as needed. The main configuration file is located at `config/config.yaml`.
