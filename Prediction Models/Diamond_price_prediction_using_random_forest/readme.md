#  Diamond price prediction prediction using Machine learning

 **Model Training and evaluation**: 
The four machine learning model random forest ,decision trees linear regression , support vector machine are selected for model training over the inputed processed data:
     random forest accuracy : 98 %
     support vector machine accuracy : 87 %
     decision trees accuracy : 97 %
     linear regression accuracy : 90 %

The 10 fold cross validation is then performed on  Random forest model to obtained a final average cross validated accuracy of 98.25 %.
