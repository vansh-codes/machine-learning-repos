# Machine Failure Prediction Using Sensor Data

**Description**

Model is trained using the data like the temperature mode , air quality index near the machine ,its rpm , input pressure etc. 

## What have I done ?

1. Downloading the dataset using Kaggle API
2. Data Summary
3. Splitting the data
4. Training models


## What were the results 

1. XGBOOST : Xgboost has performed well on the data with a accuracy score of nearly 0.88
2. RandomForestClassifier : RandomForestClassifier has given a results of nearly 0.9


## Conclusion 

This model has been trained with the aim of predicting machine failures in advance.
