# Titanic Survival Analysis

This project analyzes the survival of passengers on the Titanic using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features.

## Steps

1. Acquire Training and Testing Data:
   - The dataset is acquired from Kaggle.

2. Wrangle, Prepare, Cleanse the Data:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Drop unnecessary columns.

3. Analyze, Identify Patterns, and Explore the Data:
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

4. Model, Predict, and Solve the Problem:
   - Build and train a machine learning model.
