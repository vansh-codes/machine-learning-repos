# Bug Hunter Analysis 

The Dataset used here is taken from the Kaggle database website. You can download the file from the link given here, [Bug Hunter Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vellyy/bug-hunter/data)

## About the dataset

There are 5 types of datasets:

- `full`
- `gcf`
- `remove`
- `single`
- `subtract`

And each directory contains the dataset of all the 15 categories as follows:

- `Android-Universal-Image-Loader`
- `BroadleafCommerce`
- `MapDB`
- `antlr4`
- `ceylon-ide-eclipse`
- `elasticsearch`
- `hazelcast`
- `junit`
- `mcMMO`
- `mct`
- `neo4j`
- `netty`
- `orientdb`
- `oryx`
- `titan`

There is 1 more dataset in each folder with named `all` which contains the combined dataset of all categories.

So, Targetting to `full/all` directory which have all categories type of dataset without going one by one each and every dataset.
