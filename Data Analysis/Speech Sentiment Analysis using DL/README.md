## **Speech Sentiment Analysis using DL**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**

The objective of this project is to classify speech into its emotional context, like positive, negative or neutral.

### ðŸ§µ **Dataset**

The dataset consists of 4 directories: 2 for images and 2 for audio files. both are labelled 'TRAIN' and 'TEST', with images labelled as 'train_images' and 'test_images'.

There are '250' files in train and '110' files in test.

### ðŸ§¾ **Description**

The project deals with multi-class classification, classifying audio as images into 3 categories: Positive,Negative or Neutral emotion.

### ðŸ§® **What I had done!**

To achieve our goals, the following steps were implemented:

- Images were loaded using keras.utils and normalized to the range 0 to 1.

- Images were resized to a fixed size of 224x224 pixels.

- Custom and pre-trained models were used for this task.

### ðŸš€ **Models Implemented**

models used:

- ResNet-50
- Xception
- VGG16
- CNN-Keras
- InceptionV3
- DenseNet-121
- EfficientNetB7

### ðŸ“š **Libraries Needed**

- Keras

- Tensorflow

- Numpy

- Matplotlib
