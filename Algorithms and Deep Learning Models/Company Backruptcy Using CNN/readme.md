# Predicting Company Bankruptcy Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of company bankruptcy using financial data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs, typically used for image processing, will be adapted to analyze financial statement data for classification purposes.

## Objectives
- Data Collection: Gather financial data from public sources or databases.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean, normalize, and transform financial statements into a format suitable for CNN input.
- Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features or patterns using CNN layers.
- Model Training: Train CNN models to classify companies as bankrupt or solvent.
- Evaluation:Assess model performance and predictive accuracy.
- Deployment: Optionally, deploy the model for real-time predictions or analysis.

## Methodology
1. Data Collection:
   - Obtain financial statements (balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements) from reliable sources (e.g., SEC filings, financial databases).
   - Ensure data covers a diverse set of companies, including both bankrupt and non-bankrupt cases.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Clean data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - Normalize or scale financial metrics to facilitate model training.

3. Feature Extraction with CNN:
   - Adapt CNN architecture to process financial data effectively.
   - Utilize convolutional layers to automatically extract hierarchical features from financial statements.

4. Model Training:
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Design and train CNN models to classify companies based on financial health.
   - Consider techniques like transfer learning if applicable.

5. Evaluation:
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Validate the model's robustness through cross-validation or hold-out testing.

6. Deployment (Optional):
   - Provide instructions for deploying the trained model for predictions in a production environment.
   - Include considerations for scalability and real-time performance.

## Tools and Technologies
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- Data Sources: SEC EDGAR, financial databases (e.g., Compustat, Bloomberg)
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn (for data visualization)
