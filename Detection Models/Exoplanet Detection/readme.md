Using various machine learning models to determine the presence of Exoplanets based on their flux (luminosity). An exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star outside the solar system. The transit method measures the dimming of a star that happens to have a planet pass in front of it. This transit causes a periodic dimming in the star's flux, which appears as dips in the light curve.
