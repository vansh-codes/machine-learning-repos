2. **Data Visualization**
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**
    - Logistic Regression
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
    - CatBoost Classifier
    - XGBoost Classifier
4. **Neural Network Implementation**
5. **Model Comparison**
6. **Best Model Selection and Prediction**

## Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The initial step involved loading the dataset and performing necessary cleaning. This includes handling missing values, encoding labels, and normalizing the data.

### 2. Data Visualization

Visualizations were created to understand the waveforms of each genre. This helped in gaining insights into the data distribution and characteristics of different genres.

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation

Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated using accuracy as the metric. The results are as follows:

- **Logistic Regression**: 52.33%
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: 70.67%
- **Decision Tree**: 62.00%

The comparison of these models was visualized in a graph for better understanding.

#### Advanced Models

Further, advanced models were applied to improve accuracy:

- **Random Forest Classifier**: 78.00%
- **CatBoost Classifier**: 83.33%
- **XGBoost Classifier**: 77.33%

A comparison graph of these advanced models was also created.

### 4. Neural Network Implementation

A neural network was trained for 100 epochs, achieving a test accuracy of 75%. Accuracy and error plots were generated to visualize the training process.

### 5. Model Comparison

All the models were compared based on their accuracies. CatBoost Classifier was found to be the best performing model with an accuracy of 83.33%.


## Results

The best performing model is the **CatBoost Classifier** with an accuracy of 83.33%.
