# Email Spam Detection

This project aims to detect unwanted emails (spam) from a user's inbox. Email spam detection involves using various techniques to analyze the content, metadata, and patterns of emails to distinguish between spam and legitimate messages.
## Goal

The goal of email spam detection is to identify and filter out unsolicited emails (spam) from a user's inbox, ensuring that only legitimate and important emails are delivered. This helps in reducing clutter, protecting users from potential phishing attacks, malware, and other malicious activities commonly associated with spam emails.
## Methodology

Utilizing a combination of EDA techniques and machine learning algorithms, we have meticulously analyzed data to discern patterns and correlations associated with email . Key steps include data cleaning, feature engineering, and insightful visualization to extract meaningful insights.
## Data Preprocessing 

Data preprocessing steps include:
1. Stop words removal
2. Lemmatization/Stemming
3. Vectorization using TF-IDF
## Models Utilized

1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Regressor
3. Multinomial Naive Bayes
## Libraries Used

1. numpy: For efficient numerical operations
2. pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
3. seaborn: For visually appealing statistical graphics
4. matplotlib: For comprehensive data visualization
5. Sklearn: For implementing machine learning algorithms
## Results
1. Logistic Regression : 94%
2. Random Forest Regressor : 89%
3. Multinomial Naive Bayes : 96%

## Conclusion
Through rigorous analysis and experimentation, it has been determined that Multinomial Naive Bayes model exhibit the highest predictive accuracy for Email Spam detection.
