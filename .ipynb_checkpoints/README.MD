# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Introduction

This project involves the analysis  the Titanic dataset, which is a well-known dataset in the field of data science and machine learning. The dataset provides information on the passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographics, class, and whether they survived the disaster.

## Dataset

The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It consists of two CSV files:

- `train.csv`: This is the training set, which contains the details of a subset of the passengers, including whether they survived or not.
- `test.csv`: This is the test set, which contains similar details but without the survival information.

### Data Dictionary

The columns in the dataset are as follows:

- `PassengerId`: Unique ID for each passenger.
- `Survived`: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- `Name`: Name of the passenger.
- `Sex`: Gender of the passenger.
- `Age`: Age of the passenger.
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
- `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
- `Ticket`: Ticket number.
- `Fare`: Passenger fare.
- `Cabin`: Cabin number.
- `Embarked`: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

### Notebooks

- `data_exploration.ipynb`: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
- `data_cleaning.ipynb`: Data cleaning processes including handling missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.
- `feature_engineering.ipynb`: Creation of new features from the existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models.
- `model_training.ipynb`: Training various machine learning models on the cleaned and processed data.
- `model_evaluation.ipynb`: Evaluation of the trained models using appropriate metrics.

### Scripts

- `data_processing.py`: Contains functions for data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- `feature_engineering.py`: Contains functions for feature creation and transformation.
- `model.py`: Contains functions for model building, training, and evaluation.
