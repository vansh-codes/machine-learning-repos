0,"Aside from the pineapple on pizza debate, white chocolate is one of the most polarizing food items that has divided nations. Whichever one you prefer, the hard truth is that white chocolate isn’t really chocolate. It doesn’t contain cocoa solids. Instead, white chocolate is made of cocoa butter, milk, and sugar. "
0,"Coffee beans are a known odor neutralizer. Perfume shops even make customers sniff coffee beans when trying different fragrances. However, you must chew them if you’re really going for deodorizing – drinking coffee can actually worsen your breath through bacteria."

0,"Bob and John decide to see a movie together. But they don’t decide on what to see, or an exact time."
0,"I realize that, and I’ve been leaning toward digital marketing because in that industry I can carry over some of my skills from the current job."
